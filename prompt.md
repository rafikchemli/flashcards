Develop a minimalist flashcard application using Next.js to aid in studying for a Pilates instructor exam. The application should feature a clean, uncluttered user interface with a prominent 'Start' button to initiate the flashcard session. Implement a mechanism for random exercise selection without replacement, ensuring that all 34 exercises are displayed before any repetition occurs. Include navigation controls to allow users to revisit previous exercises. Provide a toggle function to reveal or conceal exercise descriptions. The application should also incorporate a feature to manage exercises, enabling users to edit existing flashcards (title and description), delete them, or hide them from the study session. The exercise name should be displayed prominently in the center of the flashcard, with the description appearing when the toggle is activated. The application must load exercise data from a JSON file (exercices.json), and include an option to switch between English and French. The user will manually translate the data within the exercices.json file.
